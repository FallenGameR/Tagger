What is Tagger?
---------------
Tagger is an application that annotates other windows with text and color tags. Tag is displayed on top of the window and follows it. This allows to quickly remember why do you need this particular window opened. This comes in handy when you have lots of opened windows that are nearly indistinguishable from each other - like console windows or text editors.

Requirements
------------
Windows 7 or Windows 2008 Server R2 or higher.

Installation
--------------
Download [single executable](https://github.com/FallenGameR/Tagger/raw/master/bins/Tagger.exe) and run it. That's it =)

You can also create shortcut that would start Tagger in minimized to tray mode on Windows startup:  
\- Create shortcut for tagger with 'Run Minimized' setting in properties.  
\- Place shortcut to "C:\Users\\*%USERNAME%*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup".

Manual
------
Create tag for active window - tag hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+S by default). The same hotkey hides tag.  
Change tag for active window - settings hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+D by default). Or you can right click on tag.  
Move tag with mouse drag and drop or via tag settings.
