What is Tagger?
---------------
Tagger is a Windows application that can annotate any window with a colored tag with text. Tag is displayed on top of annotated window and follows it. This allows to quickly remember why do you need this particular window that was opened a while ago among multitude of other windows. This is especially useful for windows that are nearly indistinguishable like console windows or text editors.
