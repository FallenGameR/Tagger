Pester

Objective
---------

I wanted to make a convention based Powershell Unit testing framework that didn't require the following:

* Installer of any sort
* Changing a users Profile script

The things I wanted it do do is:

* Find all tests by some sort of convention
* Emulate RSpec assertions and fixture setup
* Create NUnit XML reports
